# CSU34041 - Information-Management II @ TCD
This module is focused on the modelling of information and database system technology. More specifically, it focuses on state-of-the-art database technology, from both the user and system perspectives. From a system engineering perspective, the module examines the concepts and algorithms for: transaction processing, concurrency control, metadata representation, semantic representation and active databases, recovery, database security policies, integration of databases on the web and emerging database technologies. From an information designerâ€™s perspective, the module examines the theoretical model underpinning relational databases, functional dependency theory and normalisation (for information modelling), functional dependency modelling, object relational modelling, implementation of databases and database applications. Thus the module is intended to enable the students to design information models and implement these models in state of the art databases (relational and native web databases), as well as be able to analyse and evaluate approaches to information organisation, storage, transaction support and management.
